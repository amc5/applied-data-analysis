Homework 01

---------------------

Upload in Canvas an **RMarkdown** (Rmd) file with your notes and code for all of the CHALLENGES from Module 04, which we covered in class last week.

ALSO, please make sure that you've been able to PUSH that file up to ***GitHub*** from ***R*** (it should be accessible in your GitHub account in a repo you called "ADA-week-2". Notes in the updated Module 03 should help you accomplish this (and, of course, feel free to come see me for additional help if you're having problems).

Some of you will no doubt realize that you will be able to see your colleagues' **Rmd** documents on ***GitHub*** each time they push them up, if you check out their accounts... but please refrain from doing that and **make your work your own** :)
